# Extending Outreach

You can extend the Outreach platform with custom functionality specific to your organisation. You can also create public
apps to be used by other organisations in Outreach.

For app developers Outreach offers the following tools:

- [Outreach Developer Portal](developer-portal.md) - lets you create and manage Outreach applications.
- [Outreach Extensibility SDK](sdk.md) - lets your extension access a subset of Outreach data.
- [Outreach REST API](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs) - lets you programmatically manipulate Outreach data in your
  organisation.

## What is an Outreach application?

An Outreach application is a set of extensions embedded in various places of the Outreach platform. The extensions
themselves are webapps that you create using your favorite set of web technologies. Once embedded into Outreach
extension will load within an HTML iframe and communicate with Outreach platform through the Outreach Extensibility SDK.

## Creating your first application

To get up to speed with the platform go through the steps in the [Getting started with Outreach apps](quick-start-guide.md).
