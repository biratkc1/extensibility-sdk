# Reading and writing Outreach data

For every extension that your Outreach app contains you configure (in the Outreach Developer Portal) a list of data
points that your extension can read. To write back data back to Outreach use
[Outreach REST API](../docs/outreach-api.md).

## The `OutreachContext` object

`extensibilitySdk.init()` call returns a promise that resolves with the `OutreachContext` object. This object carries
all of the Outreach data available for your extension:

- `locale` - (e.g. `en`) locale currently used in the host application.
- `theme` - design theme of the host application. Possible values are `Light` or `Dark`.
- `account` - [account data](#account) configured for your extension.
- `user` - currently logged-in [user data](#user) configured for your extension.
- `organization` - [organisation data](#organization) configured for your extension.
- `opportunity` - [opportunity data](#opportunity) configured for your extension.
- `prospect` - [prospect data](#prospect) configured for your extension.
- `config` - user-specific extension [configuration](developer-portal.md#allowing-app-specific-configuration-values) (if
  any).
- `host` - info about the host application.

`user`, `organization`, `account`, `opportunity` and `prospect` object contain a subset of the corresponding data
retrievable by [Outreach API](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#account).
